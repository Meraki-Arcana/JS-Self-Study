    1. Create a let variable called "points" and print it out.
    2. Assign "points" the number 20 and print it out.
    3. Add 15 to "points" and print it out.

    Question1: What are all the ways you can achieve step 3?
    Question2: What would happen if you tried to do this with a const variable?

let points;
console.log(points);

points = 20;
console.log(points);

points += 15; //Option 1
console.log(points);

/* Option 2

points = points + 15;
console.log(points);

Is another way of achieving step 3.
