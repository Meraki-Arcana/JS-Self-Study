/*

    Try to think of these answers before coding and printing them out:

    1. What is the result of: "1" === 1
    2. What is the result of: (3 > 2) === true
    3. What is the result of: (2 ** 2) !=== "4"
    4. What is the result of: (true === true) && (false === false);

/*  Challenge 1

    A string is NOT equal to a number data type so I think the console ill print: "false"

    Challenge 2

    3 is greater than 2 making the right side of the statement true, and the left side of the statement is already true. So, "true" will be printed into the console.


    Challenge 3

    2 multiplied by 2, equals 4. 4 is equal to 4 making this statement: "true".


    Challenge 4

    true does equal true, and false does equal false. Making this statement: "true".
